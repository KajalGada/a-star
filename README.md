## A-star
This code implements a path-finding algorithm A-star. Using distance as heuristic function, the algorithm starts at start-node and evaluates its neighbours. The least-costly neighbour is assesed further and so on till it reaches goal; while avoiding obstacles.

The start, goal and obstacles are configurable. The program provides best path as output. To test the program, run astar.m.
